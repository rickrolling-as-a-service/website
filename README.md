## Development

To run this during development, just run `yarn dev`. To lint your code and attempt to fix some problems, run `yarn lint:fix`. If you just want to lint it, only run `yarn lint`.

## Production

During production, you probably don't want to use development mode. Just run `yarn build` and then `yarn start` to build and run your project.

If you prefer a static approach, run `yarn export` instead of `yarn start`. The output will be in an `out/` folder.
